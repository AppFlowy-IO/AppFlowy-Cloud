## 🚀 Deployment
- See [deployment guide](./doc/DEPLOYMENT.md)

## 💻 Development

### Pre-requisites

You'll need to install:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Configuration
- copy the configurations from `dev.env` to `.env`
- edit the `.env` as required (such as SMTP configurations)

### Run with all dependencies
```bash
./build/run_local_server.sh
```

This process will execute all the dependencies and start the AppFlowy-Cloud server. Alternatively,
you have the option to run the AppFlowy-Cloud server independently

### Run the AppFlowy-Cloud

1. Run the dependency servers
```bash
docker compose --file docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

2. Install sqlx-cli
```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

3. Run sqlx migration
```bash
sqlx database create
sqlx migrate run
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace
```

4. Run the server
```bash
cargo run
```

### Run the tests

After the server is running, you can run the tests with:

```bash
cargo test
```

## 🐞Debugging

Effective debugging is essential for maintaining a healthy application. Here are some tools and commands to help you
troubleshoot issues in various components of the AppFlowy cloud server:

### Postgres

A web-based administration tool for PostgreSQL. Access it at [PgAdmin](http://localhost:5400)

- OR command line:
```bash
    export PGPASSWORD=password
    psql --host=localhost --username=postgres --port=5432
```

- Redis

Redis offers a powerful command line interface for managing your Redis instance. Connect using the following command:

```bash
    redis-cli -p 6379
```

### Minio

Minio provides a Web UI for easy management of your files and buckets. Access it at [Web UI](http://localhost:9001)

### Portainer
For managing Docker containers, Portainer's Web UI is an excellent tool. Access it at Web UI to easily manage Docker
environments, including container deployment, networking, volume management, and more. Access it at [Web UI](http://localhost:9442)
