## Google

Before you can use Sign in with Google, you need to obtain a [Google Cloud Platform account](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and have a project ready or create a new one.
Please follow this [guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred) to obtain the client ID and client secret.

For example, I create a project that used for localhost development. After creating a new project, you can add the OAuth 2.0 client ID by going to `APIs & Services` -> `Credentials` -> `Create Credentials` -> `OAuth client ID`.

The redirect URI should be `<your host server public ip/hostname>/callback`. For example, my host server is `localhost`, so the redirect URI is `http://localhost:9998/callback`.

Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to the `.env` file.

4. Specify your app's 'Authorization callback URL' where users will be redirected post-authorization. The redirect URI should be 
`<your host server public ip/hostname>/callback`. For example, my host server is `localhost`, so the redirect URI is `http://localhost:9998/callback`..
5. Click 'Register Application' at the bottom.
