# Deployment

- AppFlowy-Cloud is designed to be easily self deployed for self managed cloud storage
- The following document will walk you through the steps to deploy your own AppFlowy-Cloud

## Hardware Requirements

- Minimum 2GB Ram (4GB Recommended)
- Ports 80/443 available
- Because AppFlowy-Cloud will have to be running persistently (or at least whenever users need access),
  it's probably a good idea to run it on a non-end user device. It is best if you already have a home server (check
  software requirements),
  but if you don't, you can also deploy it on a cloud compute service as host server such as
    - [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) or
    - [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/virtual-machines/)

## Software Requirements

Ensure you have Docker Compose(v2) installed on your host server. Follow the official guidelines for a reliable setup:

Docker Compose is included with Docker Engine:

- **Docker Engine:** We suggest adhering to the instructions provided by Docker
  for [installing Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

For older versions of Docker Engine that do not include Docker Compose:

- **Docker Compose:** Install it as per the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Once you have it installed, you can check by running the command:

```
docker compose version
# Docker Compose version 2.23.3
```

Note: `docker-compose` (with the hyphen) may not be supported. You are advised to use `docker compose` (without hyphen)
instead.

> purposes, please consult our detailed documentation:
> [Self-Hosting AppFlowy Cloud on AWS EC2 - Step by Step Guide](./EC2_SELF_HOST_GUIDE.md)
>
> **Note:** This guide is tailored for demonstration purposes using the AWS EC2 free tier. For more customized
> deployment options, please follow the subsequent steps outlined below.

### 1. Getting source files

- Clone this repository into your host server and `cd` into it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Cloud
cd AppFlowy-Cloud
```

### 2. Preparing the configuration

- This is perhaps the most important part of the deployment process, please read carefully.
- It is required that there is a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository.
- To get started, copy the template `deploy.env` as `.env` using the following shell commands:

```bash
cp deploy.env .env
```

- Kindly read through the comments for each option
- Modify the values in `.env` according to your needs

For authentication details, refer to the [Authentication](./AUTHENTICATION.md) documentation. You will need to update
the
redirect URI to match your host server's public IP or hostname, such
as `http://<your-host-server-public-ip-or-hostname>/gotrue/callback`.
If using localhost, then just keep the default value.

```bash
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_ENABLED=true
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET=
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://your-host/gotrue/callback

# GitHub OAuth2
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_ENABLED=true
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-secret
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI=http://your-host/gotrue/callback

# Discord OAuth2
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_ENABLED=true
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your-discord-client-id
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_SECRET=your-discord-secret
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://your-host/gotrue/callback
```

### 3. Running the services

#### Start and run AppFlowy-Cloud

- The following command will build and start AppFlowy-Cloud.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Please check that all the services are running

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### 4. Optional Services

We have provided optional services in the file `docker-compose-extra.yml`.
You do not need them for a fully functional installation of AppFlowy Cloud, but they could be helpful for various
admin/debug tasks.

- `pgadmin` (Web UI to visualize the provided postgres database)
- `portainer`/`portainer_init` (Web UI to provide some monitoring and ease of container management)
- `tunnel` (Cloudflare tunnel to provide a secure way to connect AppFlowy to Cloudflare without a publicly routable IP
  address)
- `admin_frontend` (admin portal to manage accounts and add authentication methods. We recommend to keep this)
  If you wish to deploy those, edit the file accordingly and do:

```
docker compose --file docker-compose-extras.yml up -d
```

You may ignore the orphan containers warning message that docker will output.


> When using the `docker compose up -d` command without specifying a tag, Docker Compose will pull the `latest`
> tag for the `appflowy_cloud` and `admin_frontend` images from Docker Hub by default. If you've set
> the `APPFLOWY_CLOUD_VERSION`
> or the `APPFLOWY_ADMIN_FRONTEND_VERSION` environment variable, it will pull the specified version instead.

- Check that services are running correctly `docker ps -a`
- If you find a particular service not working properly, you can inspect the logs:

```bash
# Getting logs for a particular docker compose service
# You can obtain its name by running `docker ps -a`
docker logs <NAME>
# e.g. docker logs appflowy-cloud-admin_frontend-1
```

### 5. Reconfiguring and redeployment

- It is very common to reconfigure and restart. To do so, simply edit the `.env` and run `docker compose up -d` again

### 6. Upgrading the services

- To upgrade to the latest version, use `docker compose pull` and `git pull` to fetch the latest changes for
  images, docker compose files, and the configuration files.
- Then, run `docker compose up -d` to start the services.
- Alternatively, you can use a specific image tag instead of `latest`, and checkout the corresponding tag for
  the repository.

### 7. AppFlowy Web

- AppFlowy Web is a Single Page Application (SPA) that calls the endpoints in  `appflowy_cloud`, and is assumed
  to be served on a different origin that the one used for AppFlowy Cloud (eg. if you are hosting `appflowy cloud`
  on `appflowy.home.com`, `appflowy_web` may be hosted on `web.appflowy.home.com`). The source code and deployment
  guide can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Web).
- To prevent CORS issues, you will need to change `set $appflowy_web "http://localhost:3000";` in `nginx/nginx.conf`
  to the origin where you are hosting `appflowy_web`.

## Ports

- After Deployment, you should see that AppFlowy-Cloud is serving 2 ports
- `443` (https)
- `80`  (http)
- Your host server need to expose either of these ports.

## SSL Certificate

- To use your own SSL certificates for https, replace `certificate.crt` and `private_key.key`
  with your own in `nginx/ssl/` directory. Please note that the certificates in the repository are
  for demonstration purpose only and will need to be replaced by a certificate that is trusted by your devices.
  For example, you can use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), or CloudFlare Origin CA, if the AppFlowy
  Cloud endpoint is placed behind a cloudflare proxy.

## FAQ

### How do I use a different `postgres`?
  The default url is using the postgres in docker compose, in service `appflowy_cloud` and `gotrue` respectively.
  However it is possible to use an external postgres, as long as it is accessible by the services.

- You need to change the following settings:
```
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
```

- You would need to run the `supabase_auth.sh` from `migrations/before` in your hosted postgres. Make sure that the
environmental variables referenced by the script (eg. $SUPABASE_PASSWORD) have been exported before running the script.

### How do I disable signups?

If your deployed AppFlowy-Cloud is publicly available and you do not want any other users to access it, you can disable sign up
by setting the `GOTRUE_DISABLE_SIGNUP` environment variable to `true`.

### What port should I use for SMTP?

The default configuration assumes that TLS is used for SMTP, typically on port 465. If you are using STARTTLS, such as when
using port 587, please change `APPFLOWY_MAILER_SMTP_TLS_KIND` to `opportunistic`.

### Can I sign in using only using email and password?

The AppFlowy clients currently do not support email and password sign in. However, you can login to the admin portal using the admin
email and password. In the admin section, you can then add users and set their passwords. Subseqently, users can login to the portal
using their email and password, and launch the AppFlowy client via the portal.

### What functionality will I lose if the SMTP server is not set up?

Sign in via magic link will not be possible. Inviting users to workspace and accepting invitation will have to be
performed via the admin portal as opposed to links provided in emails.

### I already have an Nginx server running on my host server. How do I configure it to work with AppFlowy-Cloud?
- First, remove the `nginx` service from the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- Update the docker compose file such that the ports for `appflowy_cloud`, `gotrue`, and `admin_frontend` are mapped
  to different ports on the host server. If possible, use firewall to make sure that these ports are not accessible
  from the internet.
- Update `proxy_pass` in `nginx/nginx.conf` to point to the above ports.
