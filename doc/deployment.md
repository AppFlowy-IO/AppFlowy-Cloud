# Deployment
- AppFlowy-Cloud is designed to be easily self deployed for self managed cloud storage
- The following document will walk you through the steps to deploy your own AppFlowy-Cloud

## Hardware Requirements
- Because AppFlowy-Cloud will have to be running persistently (or at least when one of the user is using),
we recommend using cloud compute services (as your host server) such as
 - [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) or
 - [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/virtual-machines/)
- Minimum 2GB Ram (4GB Recommended)
- Ports 80/443 available


## Software Requirements

Ensure you have Docker Compose installed on your host server. Follow the official guidelines for a reliable setup:

Docker Compose is included with Docker Engine:
- **Docker Engine:** We suggest adhering to the instructions provided by Docker for [installing Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

For older versions of Docker Engine that do not include Docker Compose:
- **Docker Compose:** Install it as per the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


## Steps

> **ðŸš€Note for AWS Users:** [Here](./EC2_SELF_HOST_GUIDE.md) is a step by step guide to self host AppFlowy Cloud on AWS EC2. Skip it if you are not using AWS.


### 1. Getting source files
- Clone this repository into your host server and `cd` into it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy-Cloud
cd AppFlowy-Cloud
```

### 2. Preparing the configuration
- This is perhaps the most important part of the deployment process, please read carefully.
- It is required that that is a `.env` file in the root directory of the repository.
- To get started, copy the template `dev.env` as `.env` using the following shell commands:
```bash
cp dev.env .env
```
- There will be values in the `.env` that needs to be change according to your needs
- Kindly read the following comments for each set of settings
```bash
# This is the secret key for authentication, please change this and keep the key safe
GOTRUE_JWT_SECRET=hello456

# This determine if the user will be user automatically be confirmed(verified) when they sign up
# If this is enabled, it requires a clicking a confirmation link in the email after a user signs up.
# If you do not have SMTP service set up, or any other OAuth2 method, you should set this to true,
# or else no user will be able to be authenticated
GOTRUE_MAILER_AUTOCONFIRM=true

# if you enable mail confirmation, you need to set the SMTP configuration below
GOTRUE_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
GOTRUE_SMTP_PORT=465
GOTRUE_SMTP_USER=user1@example.com
# this is typically an app password that you would need to generate: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
GOTRUE_SMTP_PASS=somesecretkey
# You can leave this field same as GOTRUE_SMTP_USER
GOTRUE_SMTP_ADMIN_EMAIL=user1@example.com

# This is the email account that is the admin account
# which has the highest privilege level, typically use to
# manage other users, such as user creation, deletion, password change, etc
GOTRUE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
GOTRUE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

# This is the address of the authentication server
# which is the same as the public IP/hostname of your host server
# when an email confirmation link is click, this is the host that user's devices
# will try to connect to
API_EXTERNAL_URL=http://localhost:9998

# 2 fields below are only relevant for development, can ignore
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5433/postgres
SQLX_OFFLINE=false

# File Storage
# This affects where the files will be uploaded.
# By default, Minio will be deployed as file storage server # and it will use the host server's disk storage.
# You can also AWS S3 by setting USE_MINIO as false
USE_MINIO=true                    # determine if minio-server is used
# MINIO_URL=http://localhost:9000 # change this to use minio from a different host (e.g. maybe you self host Minio somewhere)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
AWS_S3_BUCKET=appflowy
AWS_REGION=us-east-1              # This option only applicable for AWS S3
```

For authentication details, refer to the [Authentication](./AUTHENTICATION.md) documentation. You will need to update the
redirect URI to match your host server's public IP or hostname, such as `http://<your-host-server-public-ip-or-hostname>/callback`.
If using localhost, then just keep the default value.

```bash
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_ENABLED=true
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_SECRET=
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:9998/callback

# GitHub OAuth2
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_ENABLED=true
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-secret
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:9998/callback

# Discord OAuth2
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_ENABLED=true
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your-discord-client-id
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_SECRET=your-discord-secret
GOTRUE_EXTERNAL_DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:9998/callback
```

### 3. Running the services

### Start and run AppFlowy-Cloud
- The following command will build and start the AppFlowy-Cloud. 

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
- Please check that all the services are running
```bash
docker ps -a
```

> When using the `docker compose up -d` command without specifying a tag, Docker Compose will pull the `latest`
tag for the `appflowy_cloud` and `admin_frontend` images from Docker Hub by default. If you've set the `BACKEND_VERSION`
environment variable, it will pull the specified version instead. If `BACKEND_VERSION` is not set, Docker Compose 
defaults to using the `latest` tag.

- The metrics endpoint can also be used to verify that the AppFlowy-Cloud server is running. It should return a status of 200 OK.
```bash
curl -v localhost:8000/metrics
```

### 4. Reconfiguring and redeployment
- It is very common to reconfigure and restart. To do so, simply edit the `.env` and do `docker compose up -d` again

## Ports
- After Deployment, you should see that AppFlowy-Cloud is serving 2 ports
- `443` (https)
- `80`  (http)
- Your host server need to expose either of the port

## SSL Certificate
- To use your own SSL certications for https, replace `certificate.crt` and `private_key.key`
with your own in `nginx/ssl/` directory
