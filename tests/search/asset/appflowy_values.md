# AppFlowy Values

## Mission Driven

- We actively lead and support the AppFlowy open-source community, where a diverse group of people is empowered to
  contribute to the common good.

Honesty

We are honest with ourselves.

We admit mistakes freely and openly.

We provide candid, helpful, timely feedback to colleagues with respect, regardless of their status or whether they
disagree with us.

We are vulnerable in search of truth and don’t defend our point to just win over others.
