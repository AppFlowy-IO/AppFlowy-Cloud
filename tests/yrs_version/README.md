The `yrs_version` test is designed to ensure that data encoded
with an older version of Yrs can be accurately decoded by the
new version of Yrs code. Each time a new version of Yrs is released,
this test should be conducted to verify compatibility with older versions.

Tests should be added and run before updating to a new version of Yrs.
